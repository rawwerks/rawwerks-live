## with PLOrk
</center>

I joined the Princeton Laptop Orchestra ([PLOrk](http://plork.cs.princeton.edu/)) in 2008 and performed with them for 3 years. In 2009, I had the honor of sharing the stage with Matmos & So Percussion for performances at The Kitchen (NYC) and Princeton. <img src="/media/PLOrk.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 55%; float: right"/>In 2010, I composed & programmed a piece for PLOrk entitled ‘[G](http://www.music.princeton.edu/~nbritt/PLOrk-spring2010/video/G.mov)‘, in which each instrument was controlled by the laptop’s internal accelerometer via the real-time machine learning environment [The Wekinator](http://wekinator.cs.princeton.edu/). [SmackTop](http://code.google.com/p/smacktop) is a related piece of software I wrote, which effectively turns (older) Mac laptops into a MIDI drum pad.

## as Altitude Sickness
</center>


Under the moniker Altitude Sickness, I started making sample-based music in 2006. Shortly thereafter I began a 4-year residency at [WPRB 103.3](http://wprb.com/) FM, where my weekly show emphasized an eclectic mix of bicoastal beats. <img src="/media/altitude_sickness.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 55%; float: right"/> In 2007, I assembled my first [monome](http://monome.org/) in a tupperware and began performing live, chopping and looping on-the-fly. As Altitude Sickness, I have played across the US, opening for a number of amazing artists including Hudson Mohawke, Daedelus, Nosaj Thing, Deakin (of Animal Collective), Mike Slott, Lucky Dragons, Edison and makingthenoise.
