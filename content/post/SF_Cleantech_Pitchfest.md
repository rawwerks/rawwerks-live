I gave a short presentation on my ARPA-E supported project towards paint-on window coatings at Berkeley Lab's Cleantech Pitchfest in San Francisco on June 1, 2016. To view the entire Pitchfest with the other 5 presenters, see https://youtu.be/gMCt2f_NlEY

*DIY Efficient Windows: Applying paint-on coatings for energy-efficient windows
Replacing millions of porous windows with energy-efficient versions in older buildings and homes can be prohibitively expensive. Berkeley Lab’s Raymond Weitekamp, a Caltech PhD, has a new approach: an inexpensive, paint-on, energy-efficient coating that can be applied simply and evenly without the help of a professional—while the windows are still in place.*
