I recently wrote about why I think it is important to [share your failures](/share-your-failures). The idea behind my *Rejected...* series of posts is to do exactly that. It is not my intention to spite those that have rejected me. Instead, I want to celebrate rejection and thank the gatekeepers for keeping me out. There might be a healthy release in ranting a bit, but catharsis is not my primary objective. My goal is to choose stories that have the potential to meet at least one of the following criteria:

* help others to not make the same mistakes
* open an avenue towards crowd-sourced constructive criticism so that I can improve
* give others the confidence to keep trying (and keep sharing)

My goal with this site is to *learn out loud*. Who knows what will happen. Sometimes the rejects become hits:
